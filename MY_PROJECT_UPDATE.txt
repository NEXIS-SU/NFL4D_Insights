My project update is that I have built several models to predict yards and gained or first downs. The beginning models poorly predicted the model using the given input variables with R^2 of around .13. Therefore, I went back into the data and created a new input variable: average yards gained. This variable calculates the average number of yards a team has scored in each game.
This variable turned out to be strong and allowed for less input variables. For example, you don’t need to use team names because average calculates the defensive score and offensive score in that game. The only issue is the data doesn’t predict plays early in each game; however, this allows for more confidence as it has more data to base the game off.
When building my models again, the RandomForestRegressor Model predicted first down completion with a MSE of only .14. Predicting first downs is more reliable than yards gained because it has less deviation while still calculating the important aspect of the play.
From here, I am looking at ways to predict and compare data for the different options.
