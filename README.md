# NFLData

Currently, the NFL uses gut decision to make decisions for the play type. This results in coaches being conservative and punting over 75% of the time.

This project is designed to use big data in order to give coaches insights that can help them make an optimal decision.

I have gathered over 350,000 plays from 2009-2017 from the NFL and will be using machine learning to analyze the data, and produce a model to predict yards gained and if they can complete a first down.
